SwitchHand allows you to change the `Main Hand` setting you can find in `Options > Skin Customization... > Main Hand` between right and left with a hotkey. Making you ambidextrous!

The default hotkey to change your main hand is `v` it can be changed in the keybinds menu, in the "Inventory" category under "Switch Main Hand".

## âš  Warning
